# ML_Kickstarter_Analyses
Kickstarter is an American public benefit corporation that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity.
The goal of each project in Kickstarter is to raise the amount of money they set as a goal at the beginning of the project.

In this project, I use a Kickstarter projects data to Analysis the effect of each project's variable and to build
a model to predict the success of the projects.
